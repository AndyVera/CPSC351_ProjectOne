# CPSC351_ProjectOne

This project includes the files jiffies.c and seconds.c that creates proc files. </br>
Whenever the proc file is called with the command cat /proc/jiffies it will print out the value of jiffies whenever it is read. </br>
When the proc file for seconds.c is called with the command cat /proc/seconds/ it will list the time in seconds since the module was loaded into the kernel
